Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program takes a decision tree trained in matlab and outputs a textfile contatining all the branch information.  This text file can be read by the containted C++ class, and then used to make decicions based on presented features in deployed applications.

It is useful for deploying code developed in matlab into other algorithms, the treebagger class is not included in the matlab Coder. 

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
extractDecTreeStruct.m matlab files takes as input a trained classification tree or a treebagger classification ensemble, and outputs a text file which can be read by the C++ class DTree in DecisionTreeClass.hpp.  in DTree are two methods, readTextFilesTrees reads the decision tree text file outputted by extractDecTreeStruct.m into a number of private arrays.  The method decisionTreeFun, then takes as input a series of features and outputs the class (integer number).  The files must always have the following postfix : _bag_x.txt, where x is the bag number.
